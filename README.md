# MMF1928 Project 1: Pricing Model for American Options

## Introduction
This project builds on and investigates the pricing model for American options. It first demonstrates the choice of numeraire is irrelevant to the evaluation of derivatives. The main part of the paper provides a methodology for calculating exercise boundaries and hedging strategies and uses simulation to estimate profit & loss and stopping time. In the end, it discusses how two parameters used in the model, volatility of the underlying asset and risk-free rate, can affect the above processes.

In this project, we consider a fixed time horizon, T, and assume two assets in the economy: risk-free bank account B, and risky underlying asset S, where its up and down movements follow the natural probability measure, P. By deriving the martingale probability measure,
Q, we evaluate an American option example and conduct further analysis.
